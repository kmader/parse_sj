# parse_sj
A simple library for parsing Science Journal Data in .sj format
The code is basically the `protoc` compiled protobufs from https://github.com/google/science-journal/tree/master/OpenScienceJournal/whistlepunk_library/src/main/proto along with a few notebooks and scripts to make things easier
